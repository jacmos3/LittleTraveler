The Traveler Loot is inspired by Loot Project: https://www.lootproject.com

The solidity smart contract and the frontend-style are taken from Loot Project
and modified for our purpose.


## A Loot for the Travel Industry
The Traveler Loot is a Loot derivative for the travel industry and the travel world in general.
The original Loot provided a public good on which the community can create games.
We are creating a public good on which the Travel industry can create marketing campaigns, fidelity programs, airdrops and so on.

In our mission to help the travel industry to transition to Web3, we will assist hotels, houses, airlines, cruise ships, tour operators etc...to drop special discounts, free nights and free trips to the Traveler Loot owners, by targeting the content of the loot itself.
If for instance you own a Loot with "Paris" and "Hotel", you may be targeted by Paris Hotels with free stays as a part of their marketing campaigns.
If you own an "Airplane" NFT, you could get a free ticket from an airline, or maybe early access to discounted NFT tickets for flights.
We will work hard to add value to these NFTs, and if we are successful they will generate a lot of travel opportunities for the owners.


## Who We Are
We are [Trips Community](https://www.tripscommunity.com/ "Trips Community"), a Travel DAO, established in 2017, a recognised as the leader in the transition to Web3 for the travel industry.
We have sold the first ever NFT booking in a [Villa in Ibiza, Spain](https://medium.com/trips-community/nft-nights-book-a-villa-with-an-nft-77e43f178909 "Villa in Ibiza, Spain") and the [first NFT Hotel booking in Venice, Italy ](https://medium.com/trips-community/the-first-nft-hotel-booking-in-history-was-sold-for-1-eth-3000-8f7d5e988ea0 "first NFT Hotel booking in Venice, Italy ").
We are also the first to organize a travel conference P[roof of Attendance NFT at the VRWRS 2021](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/93380629908989276154329187712159695682604484101294988604591734364126547280072 "roof of Attendance NFT at the VRWRS 2021") summit in Annency, in France.

## Earnings
Traveler Loots on Ethereum are mostly free + gas, except the Patron NFTs.
We are retaining 222 NFTs for the development of the project.
Sales from Patron NFTs + 222 owner Loots will be used to fund the Traveler NFT project and make it grow into the biggest NFT ecosystem of the global travel industry.

## Expenses
We will invest the money in projects which give direct value to the NFT. 
E.g.: we'll buy travel related NFTs which you can spend while travelling (there's very few of those now, but they will come).
We will mostly spend them to market the idea to travel incumbents who will then create valuable NFTs and airdrops them to Travel Loot owners.

## Conferences
The Traveler loot will be presented on the 2nd of December 2021 at the Hicon, Innovation in Travel conference in Bologna, Italy.


# How it works
Everybody can mint a Traveler Loot NFT on Ethereum, by using Etherscan here:
__ADD_LINK__ or by using our native frontend here: __ADD_LINK__


There are 4 kinds of Traveler Loot NFTs:
1) #1 to #2000: Colored NFTs reserved for owners of Loot NFT from selected Loot projects. Free + gas.
2) #2001 to #2222: Black and white Traveler Loots reserved to contract deployer (Trips Community).
3) #2223 to #10000: Black and white Traveler Loots (ordinary). Free + gas.
4) Over 10,000: will be golden Patron Traveler Loots (starting from 1 ETH) with the TokenID in the decimal version of the ETH address (so, something like 1,178,629,251,841,817,114,065,107,537,802,750,734,544,560,119,120). In other words you can create more (like in More Loot), but you pay the project which will use the money to increase the utility value of the first 10,000.
You can do that when the 10,000 are finished but also immediately if you like to have one.

**PRIORITY FOR ELIGIBLE LOOT PROJECT OWNERS**

Loot project owners have the **priority** to
mint a Traveler Loot in special edition **Colored NFT**, opening the doors for other possible
future airdrops or advantages.
The qualification for the Loot projects was based on the trading volume on OpenSea.
The qualified Loot projects are the first 15 in the list, sorted by trading volume on **DECEMBER 2021**.

By using the _**qualifiedClaim(tokenId, contractAddress)**_ function Loot project owners can mint a
Special Edition **colored NFT** on a first-come-first-served basis.
There are **14 qualified Loot and Loot derivatives projects** that have
been selected to be qualified for this purpose.

E.g.: if you own the Loot #1 from an eligible Loot project, you would be able to mint the Traveler Loot #1 using
the _**qualifiedClaim(tokenId, contractAddress)**_, just providing the tokenId you own
and the Loot address.
This will be minted in special edition (a different background and text color).

If you own a higher _tokenId_ from a previous eligible Loot project, you can claim your special edition too (for the mathematically inclined: because the number will be % by 2000).
E.g. the Traveler Loot Special Edition #500 can be minted only by those who own Loot NFTs with ID #500, #2500, #4500, #6500 etc..

So everybody can mint their special edition, if they are fast enough to claim it before they go out of supply.

Note that when you mint your number, you take it away from all the others
Loot or Loot-derivatives owners, because there will be one and only one #1.
So If you've minted it, the other owners have lost the opportunity to do the same.

Only first one who mints its own number will receive the special edition minting.

There will be only 2000 Special Traveler Loot, at maximum: from #1 to #2000.

## DERIVATIVE LOOT "GuildS"
If you have an NFT from an eligible Loot project, you are part of a Guild.
If you are the first to mint from your Guild, you will decide the Color of your Guild Traveler Loots.
There are 14 Colors.
When all 2000 Special Edition Traveler Loots have been minted, the Guild with most NFTs will WIN.
Your Guild wins the possibility to mint for free + gas a Patron NFT, which otherwise costs about 1 ETH.


## PATRON NFT

- Starting cost: **1 ETH** 
- Colour: **gold**
- Peculiarity: **your ETH address will be the TokenID, making it rare.**

**Price variability**
The minting price varies according to the number of ordinary Travel Loot NFTs minted.

- Every time a Standard NFT (#2223 to #10000) is minted the Patron NFT minting price increases by 1%
- Every time one of the owner-reserved NFTS (#2001 to #2222) is minted, the the Patron NFT minting price goes down by 5%
- Every time one an eligible Loot derivate owner mints one coloured NFT (#1 to #2000) the Patron NFT minting price increases by 2%
- Every time a Patron mints one Patron NFT the Patron NFT minting price increases by 5% (this means that every time you mint a Patron NFT, the Minting price increases)
- Every time an owner of an original Loot (created by @Dof https://opensea.io/collection/lootproject) mints a Patron with its own address, the Patron NFT minting price goes down by 5%. This privileges expires on the 40th birthday of Dhof [https://twitter.com/dhof] on 27/09/2026 23:59:59 (UTC) or when all Colored NFTs (#1 to #2000) are minted and we have a winner. Use the *claimForLooters()* method.
- Every time a winner (part of the winner Guild/Family) mints with its own address, the Patron NFT minting price goes down by 5%


## STANDARD "TRAVELER LOOT" NFTs
If you do not own any eligible Loot/Loot Derivative, then you'll be able to claim
a Standard Traveler Loot in black/white edition, just claiming from the function
_**claim(tokenId)**_.

NOTE
All which is explained here is coded in the Smart Contracts and you are free to read it on etherscan [LINK]

## 1. Installing components:
`npm install`

## 2. Configuring the .env files:
`cd ethereum`

`touch .env`

open ".env" file with your preferred text editor and write down this in it:

`MNEMONIC = "[SEED]" #put here your mnemonic seed used to deploy the contract on
the blockchain
PROVIDER_URL = "[INFURA_PROVIDER_URL]" #insert here your infura url (go to
infura.io, create account and new project, then select testnet you want to use
i.e. rinkeby and then copy the link here)`

## 3) Compiling and generating json interface
`node compile.js`

## 4) Deploying on the blockchain
`node deploy.js`

Once the deploy is succeeded, it will be generated `/.env.local` file with a
env variable containing the contract address you have deployed.

This file is used by the frontend to interact with the contract using web3.

## 5) Launch server:
`npm run dev`

go to https://localhost:3000 and feel free to use the dapp

## 6) Launching tests:

`npm run test`

NOTE: Tests are not intended to be completed. Feel free to write your own tests.


## 7) Exporting for hosting:
`npm run build && npm run export`
