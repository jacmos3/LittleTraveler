    <p>
    Traveler Loot Project is a layer built on top of Loot Project and 14 other Loot Derivatives (<a href="#Guilds">ðŸ”—Guilds</a>). By holding one of their NFT, you have access to the <span className="italic">Traveler Loot for Guilds</span> mints ranging between #1 and #900, with the Guild Flag attached to them. If you do not own any Guild's NFT, you can choose one project from them and mint one or you can buy in the secondary market. Once done you'll get instant eligibility for <span className="italic">Traveler Loot for Guild</span> NFT. <span className="italic">Traveler Loot Standard</span> ranging between #1001 and #10000 are open and free (+ gas) minting instead. Loot Project and Derivatives Loots are indipendent projects and there are no royalities or referrals related to Traveler Loot Project.
